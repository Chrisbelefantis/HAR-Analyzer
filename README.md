# Ηar Αnalyzer Application

We have developed a complete collection, management and crowdsourced information analysis of HTTP traffic data. Specifically, the application gives us access to our system administrator and users. The Administrator and the Users have different functions depending on the case and these are the following.

# Login Page

- The login page with username and security code is shown below where depending on if the user or administrator logs in, the corresponding functions are displayed.

- Registration in the system. The user registers and accesses the system by selecting a username & password of his choice, and providing his email. The password is required
be at least 8 characters and contain at least one capital letter, a number and a symbol (eg # $ * & @).
